# NS-Sample-Schema-Improved (Outdated)

**Important Notice:** This schema is considered outdated and is no longer actively maintained.

**A Helpful Starting Point for NS Beginners**

NS-Sample-Schema-Improved was designed to provide valuable libraries and resources to newcomers in the Nutscript community. It aimed to simplify the learning curve and assist users in setting up their Nutscript environment.

**Project Status and Reasons for Its Obsolescence**

Unfortunately, this project has reached a point where it's no longer viable to maintain. Nutscript, the framework it was built on, has become overly exploitable and badly, making it challenging to address issues and implement improvements. Additionally, there has been a lack of developer interest and support for Nutscript.

**Discover the Future: Lilia**

We're excited to announce that we've completely rebuilt and improved our project in the form of [Lilia](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia). Lilia offers a fresh and modern experience, addressing the shortcomings of Nutscript and delivering ongoing development.

If you're seeking a more up-to-date, robust, and user-friendly alternative, we strongly recommend exploring [Lilia](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia). It's the future of our efforts to support the roleplay community
